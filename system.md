# Integrated RNA testing device

Here we document various stages involved in the RT-PCR detection of RNA from sample collection to detection. In theory, we must be able to integrate various sub-systems into a single portable and affordable device.

## Operation mode

Describing an idea easy-to-use of the device for non-technical users here...

## Requirements

* The user receives master mixes either in the cartridge form for a single use or in mini-bottles for multiple tests

## Sub-systems

* Mixer
* Centrifuge
* Thermocycler
* Gel electrophoresis
* Detection using a smartphone

## TODO
